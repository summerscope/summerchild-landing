        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <blockquote>
          Sweet Summer Child Score (SSCS) is a scoring mechanism
          for latent risk. It will help you quickly and efficiently scan
          for the possibility of harm to people and communities by a
          socio-technical system. Note that harms to animals and the
          environment are not considered.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          SSCS takes a step back from the specifics of your technology and
          looks at environmental, systems and human factors. It's intended to
          be used at the ideation part of your process, to critique product
          ideas or compare competing features. But SSCS can also be used
          post-hoc to critique an existing system, or propose approaches
          to harm mitigation.

        <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
        <p>
          If you're familiar with the system you're critiquing, it should take
          10-15 minutes to complete. Respond with your gut, don't overthink
          it too much.
        </p>

        <h3>Critiquing proposals/ideas</h3>
        <p>
          You can use the quiz to critique ideas that aren't developed yet.
          You need to have sufficiently sketched it out and have the rough shape &amp;
          feature set of the proposal or idea.
        </p>

        <h3>How is the score calculated?</h3>
        <p>
          You start with 99 points as the highest possible score.
          No one can score 100, we deduct one point to acknowledge
          the impossibility of building and deploying
          anything that is perfectly fair, accurate or bug-free.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you answer questions, points are deducted from your score. The three sections
          are worth roughly 1/3 each. The lower your final score, the higher the risk assessment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The multiplier multiplies your final calculated
          points deduction with a value between zero and one. This scales the final result
          to reflect the scale of demographic â€” for example a system which could impact 100
          people should never be identified as higher risk than a system which could
          impact 1 million.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can explore the scoring mechanism in detail in the <strong>questions.json file</strong>.
          This is an open source repo, pull requests and feedback welcome!
        </p>

        <h3>Why a score at all?</h3>
        <p>
          Great question! It's more a MacGuffin, less a serious device. The meta-work
          of this quiz is to remember that all aspects of this and any risk assessment
          are subjective: how the quiz is composed, the questions that are included
          and excluded, how they are weighted, how and who answers the questions,
          what they do with the final score and recommendations. While isn't a deep
          learning model, it is a perfect model of how all socio-technical systems
          operate in the real world: as a series of opinions and educated guesses
          encoded and turned into a repeatable process. It's up to you to decide
          whether those opinions and educated guesses are good.
        </p>

        <h3>Who can use it?</h3>
        <p>
          This is designed for use by data scientists, product managers, and
          other technologists. However it's simple enough that end-users,
          journalists and auditors can use it to critique an opaque system.
          This score is model and stack agnostic, so you don't
          need to see 'under-the-hood' to use it.
        </p>
        <h3>How should you use it?</h3>
        <p>
          This is a qualitative assessment and relies on you to complete it
          honestly. There's no point if you're just going to give yourself
          the best score! Without discussing first, have multiple people
          in your team complete the quiz. How close were your scores? Which
          areas did you agree and disagree? Discuss and attempt to resolve
          the differences, especially where there is higher variance in the answers.
        </p>
        <h3>Why don't we scan for minority identities?</h3>
        <p>
          We focus on the disadvantages usually experienced by these populations
          rather than the demographics of disadvantage. We don't want to
          contribute to the conflation of minority identities and harm.
